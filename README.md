# Task-3-UQMetric
# The UQ metrics are categorized in three parts: single time series, ensemble member, and multiple time series. 
# For single time series, we consider moving-window based metrics instead of point to point metrics. These metrics reflect the informativeness of the given data. 
# For ensemble members, we quantify uncertainty from multiple ensemble data sources. 
# For multiple spatial time series, we quantify the uncertainty from wind farm turbine layout. The uncertainty among turbines is converted to a function of uncertainty and distance.
